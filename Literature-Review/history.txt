The history of social media can be traced back to the late 1960s with the advent of computer-based communication technologies such as email and bulletin board systems (BBS). These early forms of online communication allowed users to send messages and share information, but they were limited to text-based communication and lacked the multimedia features and user-friendly interfaces that are now common in social media.

In 1997, the social networking site Six Degrees was launched, allowing users to create profiles and connect with friends. However, it was not until the launch of Myspace in 2003 and Facebook in 2004 that social media began to gain widespread popularity. Over the next decade, a multitude of new social media platforms emerged, including YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat, among others.

Social media has had a profound impact on society, transforming the way people communicate, consume news and information, and engage with brands and businesses. It has also raised important questions about privacy, data protection, and the spread of misinformation. Despite these challenges, social media continues to grow in popularity and remains an integral part of the modern digital landscape.
