    College students may be more affected by the social isolation and online learning associated with the pandemic, leading to increased use of social media and higher levels of anxiety and depression. This is because college students may have less established support networks, be more reliant on in-person social interaction, and face unique challenges such as online learning and limited campus resources. On the other hand, non-college students may be more affected by job loss, financial insecurity, and other economic factors, leading to increased stress and decreased mental well-being.
