# Chapter 6 Constructing Hypotheses

## Definition
- Verification of an assumption / asserting
- Assertions become the basis of the enquiry and are called hypotheses
- **Hypotheses bring focus to the research problem in quantitative research**
- Ginnell's definition:
    - a tentative proposition that can be proven or disproven
    - validity is unknown, hence reliable and valid data needed
    - specifies a relationship between variables
## Functions of a hypothesis 
- THe formulation of a hypothesis brings specificity and clarity to a study
- Testing of a hypothesis enables the researcher to epecifically conclude what is true or what is false

## How to forumulate a hypothesis
- a hypothesis should be simple, specific and conceptually clear
- a hypothesis should be capable of verification
- a hypothesis should be related to the existing body of knowledge
- a hypothesis should be measureable

### Null hypothesis
- hypothesis of no difference
- The null hypothesis states that there is no difference between two situations, groups, outcomes, or the prevalence of a condition or phenomenon
- Hypothesis of difference/alternative hypothesis: There is a difference in the average age of male and female students in this class.

## Errors in testing hypothesis
Incorrect conclusions about the validity of a hypothesis may be drawn if:
- the study design selected is faulty
- the sampling procedure adopted is faulty
- the method of data collection 

ex: The average age of male students in this class is higher than that of the female students
